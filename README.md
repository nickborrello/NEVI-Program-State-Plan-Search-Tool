# NEVI Plan Keyword Search Tool

[![Sponsored by Atlas Public Policy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Sponsored_by-Atlas_Public_Policy-blue)](https://www.atlaspolicy.com/)

A Python-based tool to help analysts and researchers search through state NEVI plans for structured answers to key questions. The tool uses logic-based keyword matching to find pages that discuss specific topics in uploaded PDF documents.

Originally developed for a WPI undergraduate research initiative, **sponsored by Atlas Public Policy**.

python main.py
```

## 🧠 JSON Term Structure

Each question has grouped terms. A page matches if **at least one word from each group** appears on it.

Example:

```json
{
  "Equity": {
    "How does the state identify disadvantaged communities?": [
      ["underserved", "disadvantaged", "DAC", "marginalized"],
      ["define", "identify", "locate"],
      ["engagement", "collaboration", "mapping tool"]
    ]
  }
}
```

## 🧑‍💻 Background

This project was originally developed as part of a WPI undergraduate research initiative in response to the **National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI)** program.

The research and tool development were **sponsored by Atlas Public Policy** to assist in accelerating EV adoption and infrastructure analysis.
